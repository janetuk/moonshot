 Libraries have been installed in:
    /Users/pete/tmp/usr/local/lib/gss

 If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
 in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
 specify the full pathname of the library, or use the `-LLIBDIR'
 flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
    - add LIBDIR to the `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
      during execution

 See any operating system documentation about shared libraries for
 more information, such as the ld(1) and ld.so(8) manual pages.
