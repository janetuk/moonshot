### Building Mac OS Installer using jhbuild

## Preparation
Install jhbuild, which Creates working folder ~/gtk

Need Kerberos installed in ~/gtk/inst - in the Krb5 src directory 
$ export CFLAGS="-arch i386"
$ ./configure --prefix=/Users/pete/gtk/inst/
$ make
$ make install

## Building the moonshot SW
copy file moonshot/mac-client-installer/.jhbuildrc-custom to $HOME
then
$ jhbuild bootstrap





###Introduction

This page contains notes on how to build and install the software necessary to run Moonshot clients on a computer running Max OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard and 10.7 Lion.

It also contains instructions for creating an installer package allowing the Moonshot software to be installed on other machines running Mac OS X.

These notes are also in the file mac-client-installer/README.MacOsBuildInstructions

There are three components that need to be built and installed:

1: the Cyrus SASL2 library, along with the SASL GS2 Library which implements the GS2 GSS-API->SASL bridge mechanism.

2: the Moonshot GSS EAP library, implements the EAP mechanism for use by the GSS API. This library depends on having a recent version of Kerberos. Mac OS X ships with Kerberos 5 release 1.7-prerelease which is not recent enough. So. for the installer at least, we will get and build the latest stable release (1.9.2) from [MIT](from http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/dist/index.html).

3: the Moonshot Identity Selector/Manager software which...

###Getting the Moonshot source code 

Follow the instructions at http://www.project-moonshot.org/developers/repository, cloning  the repo in $HOME

Working in $HOME/moonshot/mac-client-installer

###Building the Cyrus SASL2 library

    $ cd $HOME/moonshot/cyrus_sasl
    $ ./autogen.sh 

You will see the following message

    configure.in:14 error: possibly undefined macro: AC_DEFINE
    If this token and others are legitimate, please use m4_pattern_allow.
    See the Autoconf documentation

    $ ./configure --with-gss_impl=mit
    $ make

To install to /usr/local in your build machine

    $ sudo make install

Create the link from /usr/lib/sasl2 (where the library looks for the plugins)->/usr/local/lib/sasl2 (where the plugins will be installed)

    $ cd sasl/usr/lib
    $ ln -fs   ../local/lib/sasl2 

Or, if you are making the installer

    $ make install DESTDIR=$HOME/moonshot/mac-client-installer/sasl

Create the link from /usr/lib/sasl2 (where the library looks for the plugins)->/usr/local/lib/sasl2 (where the plugins will be installed)

    $ mkdir sasl/usr/lib
    $ cd sasl/usr/lib
    $ ln -fs   ../local/lib/sasl2 
    $ cd ../../..
    $ cd ~/installerbuild

The files and directories that are installed are as listed in README.saslInstalledFiles

###Building the downloaded Kerberos

Unpack the file to $HOME/krbbuild

    $ cd $HOME/krbbuild/krb5-1.9.2-signed/krb5-1.9.2/src
    $ ./configure
    $ make

To install to /usr/local in your build machine

    $ sudo make install

Or, if you are making the installer
    $ make install DESTDIR=$HOME/moonshot/mac-client-installer/krb

###Building the Moonshot GSS EAP library

    $ cd $HOME/moonshot/moonshot
    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ ./configure --enable-acceptor=no 

You will see the following warnings

    configure: WARNING:
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Cannot find OpenSAML libraries, building without OpenSAML support.
    Please install OpenSAML or specify installation directory with
    --with-opensaml=(dir).
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    configure: WARNING:
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Cannot find Shibboleth resolver libraries, building without
    Shibboleth support.
    Please install Shibboleth or specify installation directory with
      --with-shibresolver=(dir).
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    $ make
    $ cd mech_eap
    $ sudo make install
    $ libtool --finish /usr/local/lib/gss

Or, if you are making the installer

    $ ./configure --enable-acceptor=no --with-krb5=$HOME/moonshot/mac-client-installer/krb/usr/local
    $ make

We only need to install the mech_eap library

    $ cd mech_eap
    $ make install DESTDIR=$HOME/moonshot/mac-client-installer/krb

The files and directories that are installed are as listed in README.KrbInstalledFiles

###Building the Moonshot Identity Selector/Manager software
ToDo: Complete this section when the client software is ported to Mac OS

###Make the install package
Ideally we would divide the installer into sub-packages (sasl and krb) within a single meta package. However this seems to be possible only from the packagemaker GUI: there are a number of problems with doing this from the packagemaker command line. We are therefore building a single package, with sasl and krb as choice items within the package.

Ensure the permissions are correct for the files to be installed

    $ sudo chown -R root:admin krb sasl
    $ sudo chmod -R g+w krb sasl

Build the package

    $ /Developer/usr/bin/packagemaker --doc Moonshot\ Client\ Software.pmdoc \
      --version 0.1 --filter "/.DS_Store" --resources ./resources/ --root-volume-only\
      --domain system --verbose --no-relocate -l "/" --target 10.5 \
      --id ja.net.moonshotClientSoftware  --out Moonshot\ Client\ Software.pkg

Instructions in DevWiki at http://www.project-moonshot.org/devwiki//building_client_software_for_mac_os

###Making the Disk Image
Create and mount the image - 2MB will be enough for now

    $ hdiutil create -size 2m -fs HFS+ -volname "Moonshot Client Software" temp.dmg
    $ hdiutil attach temp.dmg

Copy the package and the READMEs
    $ cp Moonshot\ Client\ Software.pkg /Volumes/Moonshot\ Client\ Software/
    $ cp resources/*  /Volumes/Moonshot\ Client\ Software/

Get rid of hidden files and folders that we don't need

    $ sudo rm -rf /Volumes/Moonshot\ Client\ Software/.fseventsd/
    $ sudo rm -rf /Volumes/Moonshot\ Client\ Software/.Trashes/
    $ sudo find /Volumes/Moonshot\ Client\ Software -name '.*' -type f -delete

Unmount the image

    $ hdiutil detach /Volumes/Moonshot\ Client\ Software

Convert the disk image to read-only

    $ hdiutil convert temp.dmg -format UDZO -o moonshotclientsoftware.dmg
    $ rm temp.dmg

The compressed disk image containing the installer package and the READMEs is now in file *moonshotclientsoftware.dmg*
