### Building Mac OS Installer using jhbuild
This document contains instructions for building the Mac OS Installer for the Moonshot GSS EAP and SASL GS2 libraries, and the Moonshot Identity Selector software.
The jhbuild build tool is used to build software, and must be installed as described at http://developer.gnome.org/jhbuild/unstable/getting-started.html.en.
The Gtk+ tool gtk-mac-bundler is used to make the Identity Selector Mac OS application bundle https://live.gnome.org/GTK%2B/OSX/Bundling
The Moonshot software requires Kerberos version 1.9.2, which is more recent than the version shipped with the target versions of Mac OS X, so must be downloaded from http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/dist/krb5/1.9/ and unpacked.
The software to be installed, the installer package and the disk image are produced by running the script build-installer.sh in this directory. 

## Preparation
++++++++++++++
1: Install jhbuild, which Creates working folder ~/gtk

2: MIT Kerberos 1.9.2 Kerberos 
Install in ~/gtk/inst to build against  - in the Krb5 src directory 
jhbuild run build-krb5.sh
Inside jhbuild shell

## Building the Software, Installer Package and Disk Image
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
In the folder ~/moonshot/mac-client-installer, run the script build-installer.sh
$ ./build-installer.sh

## Known issues
+++++++++++++++
The first time the build-installer.sh script is run the following errors may be generated:
