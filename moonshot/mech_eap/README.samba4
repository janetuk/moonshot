Notes on using Moonshot with Samba4. Replace paths as appropriate.

Samba
-----

* Download Samba4 and apply patches for mechanism agnosticism which are
  available at http://www.padl.com/~lukeh/samba/
* Join Samba as a member server or domain controller (only tested former)
* Extract local service principal key to keytab (currently there do not
  appear to be tools to do this, but you can get the cleartext password
  from /usr/local/samba/private/secrets.ldb)

Shibboleth
----------

* Add a mapping from the PAC RADIUS attribute to urn:mspac: in the file
  /usr/local/etc/shibboleth/attribute-map.xml:

  <GSSAPIAttribute name="urn:ietf:params:gss-eap:radius-avp urn:x-radius:1679163525"
                   id="urn:mspac:" binary="true"/>

FreeRADIUS
----------

Install the rlm_mspac module and configure per below.

* Install dictionary.ukerna so MS-Windows-Auth-Data is defined
* Create /usr/local/etc/raddb/modules/mspac with the following:

    mspac {
        keytab = /etc/krb5.keytab
        spn = host/host.fqdn@KERBEROS.REALM
    }       

* Add mspac to instantiate stanza in radiusd.conf
* Add mspac to post-auth stanza in sites-enabled/inner-tunnel

You will need to have a TGT for the host service principal before starting
radiusd. It's easiest to do this with kinit -k.

Testing
-------

The Samba server doesn't require any specific command line arguments, although
on OS X it was necessary to start it with -M single to function under gdb.

For the client, the GSS EAP mechanism can be specified on the command line:

smbclient --password samba --mechanism 1.3.6.1.4.1.5322.22.1.18 '\\host\share'".

There is no Moonshot SSPI implementation as yet, so it is not possible to test
with a Windows client.
