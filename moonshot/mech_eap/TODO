- gssEapAcquireCred should validate RADIUS configuration
- integration with initiator-side EAP channel bindings
- always intern OIDs so they never need to be freed
- handle many-to-many Shibboleth attribute mappings; need to encode both attribute and value index into more
- add --with-xerces option
- proper acquire_cred_ext implementation pending specification
