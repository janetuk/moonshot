/* XXXX this code currently makes the assumption that a mech oid will

   the interfaces, so the code can be fixed if the OSI namespace
   balloons unexpectedly. */

/*
 * Each token looks like this:
 * 0x60                 tag for APPLICATION 0, SEQUENCE
 *                              (constructed, definite-length)
 * <length>             possible multiple bytes, need to parse/generate
 * 0x06                 tag for OBJECT IDENTIFIER
 * <moid_length>        compile-time constant string (assume 1 byte)
 * <moid_bytes>         compile-time constant string
 * <inner_bytes>        the ANY containing the application token
 * bytes 0,1 are the token type
 * bytes 2,n are the token data
 *
 * Note that the token type field is a feature of RFC 1964 mechanisms and
 * is not used by other GSSAPI mechanisms.  As such, a token type of -1
 * is interpreted to mean that no token type should be expected or
 * generated.
 *
 * For the purposes of this abstraction, the token "header" consists of
 * the sequence tag and length octets, the mech OID DER encoding, and the
 * first two inner bytes, which indicate the token type.  The token
 * "body" consists of everything else.
